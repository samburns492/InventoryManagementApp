# InventoryManagementApp
JDK 11 application using MVC architecture. Written using Apache Netbeans IDE 11.3

Java application that uses JavaFX 11 to create an inventory management application with
a GUI. The program creates both a product class and associated part classes. The part class then
has both outsourced part and in-house part derived classes.

The applicaiton allows users to add, modify and delete a local inventory of products and assocaited parts.
There is no associated Database so the inventory is not persistent after closing the application.
